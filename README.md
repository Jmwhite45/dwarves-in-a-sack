# Dwarves in a Sack
Have you ever wanted to put your annoying dwarf friend in a sack? Maybe roast them over a fire or squash them into jelly? This module allows you to do so. You can now put any actor into a container.

Simply drag and drop an actor on which you have at least limited permissions from the actor tab to the container.

Weight is automatically calculated by the weight of the actor and the weight of all their items.
